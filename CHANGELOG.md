## v.1.2.2

- added unblur, zoomIn, and zoomOut transitions for the AnimateInView component
- update overflow on AnimateInView component to be visible
- fix margin in header component
- remove height from framework.css
- added LookAtCursor component. This component allows you to wrap another component and have that component rotate to look at the cursor as it moves around. The component provides a data-origin-element attribute that will let you define where the cursor should be tracking from. For example, you could set data-origin-element="body". This is useful for doing things like having a group of elements all keep perspective while scrolling down the page.

## v.1.2.1

- added the AnimateInView component. This component allows you to wrap another component and place an animation on it that will play when the element comes into view.

## v.1.2.0

- added data binding
- updated how components are constructed and removed exports. customElements.define gets called when the module is loaded, so there is nothing to export.
- new window component can load components into a moveable window
  - the window component is in beta
  - the window component requires a parent element that is set to the size you want the window to maximize to. for example, if you want the window to maximize to full screen and minimize to the bottom of the screen, you will need a parent element that is set to those dimensions.
  - more concrete examples will be made available once the component is out of beta, but feel free to poke around and take a look at how it works!
- updated README.md to include the above updates with more documentation.
